    "The dataset used in this project was the \"House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques\" and it's available at Kaggle in the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview/evaluation).\n",

    "The data were processed and visualized. Than a regressor model was built trying to predict the houses sale prices based on the available features. Five regressor models were tested and LightGBM showed the best results. In order to improve those results, a hyperparameter optimization step was implemented to fine-tune the model."
